# Exapunks Records
A collection of my record solutions for exapunks, by Bacardi or u/bmidtvedt on reddit.

I felt that the optimization scene has gone fairly stale, and as such, I've decided to upload all of my current records. Feel free to use these as a basis for further optimization!

## Solution parsing

A row of "=" is used to separate EXA's. The first row of each EXA is either GLOBAL or LOCAL, depending on it's starting MODE.

# Note
It will take me some time to upload all of my solutions. If you want me to get to a particular solution faster, just message me.
