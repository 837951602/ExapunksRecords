# *This repo has been superseded*

This repo was intended to showcase the code behind record solutions. This is now implemented in the official [wiki leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/exapunks/wiki/index/). All records here can be found on the leaderboard.

# Exapunks Records

A collection of record solutions for Exapunks, by Bacardi (u/bmidtvedt) and Grimmy (u/Grimy_).

I felt that the optimization scene has gone fairly stale, and as such, I've decided to upload all of my current records. Feel free to use these as a basis for further optimization!

## Solution parsing

A row of "=" is used to separate EXA's. The first row of each EXA is either GLOBAL or LOCAL, depending on its starting MODE. Remember that order matters.

## Note

Also, there are a few cases where I tie a record, but don't hold the subrecord (the other scores in the triplet). I will still post these. 
There also a few levels missing, these are the ones I haven't at least tied yet.
