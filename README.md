# Exapunks Records
A collection of my record solutions for exapunks, by Bacardi or u/bmidtvedt on reddit.

I felt that the optimization scene has gone fairly stale, and as such, I've decided to upload all of my current records. Feel free to use these as a basis for further optimization!

## Solution parsing

A row of "=" is used to separate EXA's. The first row of each EXA is either GLOBAL or LOCAL, depending on it's starting MODE. Remember that order matters.

# Note
Also, there are a few cases where I tie a record, but don't hold the subrecord (the other scores in the triplet). I will still post these. 
There also a few levels missing, these are the ones I haven't at least tied yet.
